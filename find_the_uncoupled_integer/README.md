# Find the Uncoupled Integer

Write a program that, given a list of integers as an argument to STDIN

```
n1, n2, n3, ..
```

Prints out the only uncoupled (unpaired) integer in the list to STDOUT.

### Example

Given the input

```
1, 2, 3, 1, 2

```

Given the input

```
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 99, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5
