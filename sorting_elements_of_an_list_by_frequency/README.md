# Sorting Elements of an List by Frequency

Given an array of integers, sort the array according to frequency of elements. For example, if the input array is {2, 3, 2, 4, 5, 12, 2, 3, 3, 3, 12}, then modify the array to {3, 3, 3, 3, 2, 2, 2, 12, 12, 4, 5}. 

If frequencies of two elements are same, print them in increasing order.

## Constraints:

1 ≤ T ≤ 70
30 ≤ N ≤ 130
1 ≤ A [ i ] ≤ 60 

## Example:

```
Input:
1
5
5 5 4 6 4

Output:
4 4 5 5 6
```
