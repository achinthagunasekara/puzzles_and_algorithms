# Find numbers represented as sum of two cubes for two different pairs - Techie Delight

Given a large number N, find all positive numbers less than N that can be represented as sum of two cubes for at-least two different pairs. In other words, find all positive numbers M less than given number N that can be expressed as M = (a^3 + b^3) = (c^3 + d^3) for distinct a, b, c, d.

## Example

```
1729 = 1^3 + 12^3 = 9^3 + 10^3
4104 = 2^3 + 16^3 = 9^3 + 15^3
13832 = 2^3 + 24^3 = 18^3 + 20^3
20683 = 10^3 + 27^3 = 19^3 + 24^3
```
