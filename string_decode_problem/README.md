# String Decode Problem


If a=1, b=2, c=3,….z=26. Given a string, find all possible codes that string can generate. Give a count as well as print the strings.

## example

```
Input: “1123″.
```

You need to general all valid alphabet codes from this string.

```
Output List
aabc //a = 1, a = 1, b = 2, c = 3
kbc // since k is 11, b = 2, c= 3
alc // a = 1, l = 12, c = 3
aaw // a= 1, a =1, w= 23
kw // k = 11, w = 23
```
