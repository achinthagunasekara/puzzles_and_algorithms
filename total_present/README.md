Given an array of integers, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to a specific target.

You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.

## Example:

### Input

```
Given nums = [2, 7, 11, 15]
Target = 9,
```

### Output

```
[0, 1]
```

### Explanation

Because nums[0] + nums[1] = 2 + 7 = 9,
