# Find Prime numbers in a range

Generate all prime numbers between two given numbers.

## Input

The first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. Then T test cases follow. Each test case consists of a single line containing two space separated integers m and n.

## Output

For every test case print all prime numbers p such that m <= p <= n, space separated. Separate the answers for each test case by a new line.

```
Constraints:
1<=T<=60
1 <= m <= n <= 100000,
n - m <= 100000
```

# Example

## Input

```
2
1 10
3 5
